We require a few different commands here, since we are using C++:
- compile to .exe with: taffo -o test.exe test.cpp fourier_modified.cpp complex.cpp -lstdc++ -lm
- run with: ./text.exe <N> output.txt

- compile to LLVM-IR with: taffo -fno-discard-value-names -S -emit-llvm -o test.ll test.cpp fourier_modified.cpp complex.cpp -lstdc++ -lm

Top function name in the IR: _Z23radix2DitCooleyTykeyFftPiP7ComplexS1_
Note: substitute fft.cpp -> test.cpp and fourier.cpp -> fourier_modified.cpp in order to have TAFFO's optimization NOT synthesized.

TAFFO:
Works as expected.

HLS:
Does not complete with an error that usually happens when there are arrays of size not fixed at compile time, however that is not the case...
