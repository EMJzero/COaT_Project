TAFFO:
Works as expected.

HLS:
Works as expected.

PandA-Bambu does NOT support int96, so its usage must be prevented...untill then this test will not work!
FIXED with: 
 - DEPRECATED: requires the usage of "-Xconversion -maxtotalbitsconv -Xconversion 64" and "-Xdta -maxtotalbits -Xdta 64" options!
 - CURRENT FIX: usage of TAFFO's develop branch

 => thus use --no-taffo-regen for this one!

Required tricks:
- make the new fixed point function "dso_local"
- change the interface to ints* and longs*
- add code to force TAFFO to do a convertion at the start of main, so that you can immediately get the scale factor,
    copy such scale factor into your test_generator and generate already scaled input values for the now-fixed-point function!


Well removing the coversion here yields virtually no benefit...the problem its just that the code does not benefit from TAFFO once synthesized!
However removing the optimization recovers a bit of performance.
