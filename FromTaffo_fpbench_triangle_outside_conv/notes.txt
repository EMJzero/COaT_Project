TAFFO:
Works as expected.

HLS:
Works as expected.

Use the latest TAFFO version (develop branch).
Link math.h with -lm both on TAFFO and PandA!

Required tricks:
- make the new fixed point function "dso_local"
- change the interface to ints* and longs*
- add code to force TAFFO to do a convertion at the start of main, so that you can immediately get the scale factor,
    copy such scale factor into your test_generator and generate already scaled input values for the now-fixed-point function!


Well removing the coversion here yields virtually no benefit! Nice!
