TAFFO:
Works as expected.

Important:
Do not annotate "in", it causes the wrong read from "scanf".
Use "-Xvra -max-unroll=0" if using TAFFO "master" branch.

Use TAFFO develp, it does not work with the old build...

HLS:
Works as expected.

The lower values in the simulations results are the exact square roots that take less cycles to be computed!
