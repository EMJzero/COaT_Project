TAFFO:
Works as expected.

HLS:
Works as exptected. (with the fixes described below)


Here you need to link "math.h", add "-lm".

You need to adopt countermeasures to prevent types like i96 and i128, but at the same time prevent divisions by 0...
I attempted two methods:
- using "-O0" and adding a useless "*1000" at both numerator and denominator, that worked 1/2 of the time...
- disabling optimization around the division, that gives up on some speedup in order to actually work!

COMPILE WITH:
-> taffo -fno-discard-value-names -Xconversion -maxtotalbitsconv -Xconversion 64 -S -emit-llvm -o test.ll test.c
Where "taffo" is the current develop branch's version!

Note that you can ignore an FP error of 1 in Verilator, but any higher error fails the simulation.
Rarely some generated tests will produce such higher-than-1 errors, simply regenerating the test should fix it.

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT recempile this as the IR was MANUALLY altered to remove the "muladd" intrinsic of LLVM-15, in order to work with PandA's LLVM-12.
