TAFFO:
Works as expected.

HLS:
Works as expected.

Requires TAFFO's develop branch, thus do not recompile!

Enlarging the real ranges from [0, 1] to [-0.1, 1.1] was required to prevent massive errors from TAFFO.

Required tricks:
- make the new fixed point function "dso_local"
- change the interface to ints* and longs*
- add code to force TAFFO to do a convertion at the start of main, so that you can immediately get the scale factor,
    copy such scale factor into your test_generator and generate already scaled input values for the now-fixed-point function!


This seems overall worse than its counterpart, but that is simply due to the randomly generated dataset, that takes longer to converge.
Anyway "exp" still not converted, and there is not much benefit in not synthesizing the convertion!
