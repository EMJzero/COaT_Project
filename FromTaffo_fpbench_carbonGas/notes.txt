TAFFO:
Works as expected.

HLS:
Works as expected.


PandA-Bambu does NOT support int96, so its usage must be prevented...untill then this test will not work!
FIXED with: 
 - DEPRECATED: requires the usage of "-Xconversion -maxtotalbitsconv -Xconversion 64" and "-Xdta -maxtotalbits -Xdta 64" options!
 - CURRENT FIX: usage of TAFFO's develop branch

 => thus use --no-taffo-regen for this one!
