TAFFO:
Works as expected.

HLS with TAFFO:
Does not work...
PandA-Bambu fails to generate the reference testbench values (likely locally building PandA-Bambu locally could fix this...).

PandA-Bambu does NOT support int96, so its usage must be prevented...untill then this test will not work!
FIXED: requires the usage of "-Xconversion -maxtotalbitsconv -Xconversion 64" and "-Xdta -maxtotalbits -Xdta 64" options!
